    title: "Critical Bug Fixes: P1 Response Validation & P2 File Logging"
    spec_id: SPEC-license-request-001
    completed_at: "2025-12-26"
    priority: critical
    outcome: |
      Fixed two critical bugs identified in code review:

      P1 (session_manager.py:114): Removed "or response.status_code == 200" from
      success logic, preventing false positives when portal returns HTTP 200 with
      error pages. Added 2 tests to verify correct behavior.

      P2 (nexacro_license_requester.py:30-50): Implemented file logging handler
      to write logs to logs/nexacro_license_request.log, ensuring GitHub Actions
      can upload log artifacts on failure. Added 2 tests for handler validation.

      All 47 tests passing with 96% coverage (improved from 95%).
